\section{Progressive collapse}
Punching shear failure leaves the structure vulnerable after which the structural system will seek achieving a new stable balance to accomodate internal force distribution between the surrounding connections which could be assimilated to a column loss/removal case culminating into a chain reaction known as the progressive collapse of the overall structure\citep{zhao2015,king2004,PARK2012119}.
Considering progressive collapse and column removal it could be stated that in flat slabs the pressure absorbed formerly by the removed columns cannot in the absence of beams be transferred thus these slabs are more prone to collapse than slab-beam-column systems\citep{Singh2023}. 

 On paragraph 3-3-5-4 \citep{28002014} %herein referred to as the Iranian code
 emphasizes use of moment frames or dual systems for buildings above 15 stories or 50m in height stating that in this class of buildings the designer should not rely merely on shear walls or braced frames for lateral seismic loads.
