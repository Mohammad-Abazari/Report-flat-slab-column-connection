  abstract  = {This paper presents the seismic vulnerability evaluation of a 27-story reinforced concrete flat slab-core building, which had not been designed for seismic forces. The evaluation is based on the FEMA-178 handbook in conjunction with structural identification by modal testing and sensitivity analyses. Experimentally determined dynamic characteristics and lateral flexibility are used to develop and calibrate a three-dimensional (3D) analytical model. Response spectrum sensitivity studies are conducted. The parameters that influence the degradation of the lateral stiffness under seismic loading are considered for predicting possible demand envelopes under expected and maximum credible earthquakes. Evaluation of demands versus capacities at the element level indicates that the building is adequate for FEMA-178 specified forces but vulnerable to the maximum credible earthquake. Exterior slab-column connections are found to be the weakest links in the building. Investigation of the failure behavior of the building during its implosion is also presented. Problems in the application of FEMA-178 to buildings typical of the midwestern and eastern United States are noted, and suggestions for improvement are presented.},

Rubberized concrete provides a suitable way for tire waste disposal by replacing aggregates in concrete with crumb rubber. There have been several studies conducted on both geopolymer concrete as well as rubberized concrete. A combination of both these to form a rubberized geopolymer concrete promises to be sustainable construction material, which has been a hot topic among researchers recently. Important aspects such as constituents, mixing and curing aspects, physical and fresh properties, durability properties, and mechanical properties of RuGPC conducted on previous works are reviewed. The effect of crumb rubber addition, alkali, binder type, the alkali to binder ratio, and curing type on the above-mentioned aspects are reviewed. From the review of literature, it was found that durability in terms of wear depth is only 0.8 mm even with 30{\%} replacement of fine aggregates by crumb rubber. New treatments that can be given to crumb rubber for improving the bonding between geopolymer matrix and rubber is also highlighted in this work.},

abstract = {Progressive collapse in a building has caused local and subsequent damage throughout the system to spread and large-scale causes the collapse of the entire building. Progressive collapse is usually due to fire, gas explosion, terrorist attack, vehicle collisions, misplaced design and construction. Therefore, it is necessary to study the iMPact of this phenomenon and rebuild the building against it. Based on this, in this research, we will examine and evaluate practical solutions for reinforcing reinforced concrete frames against progressive collapse. The proposed solutions in this study were the use of reinforcing bars at the top and bottom of the beam, the effect of the layout of the cross section reinforcement for the participation in the chain performance, the use of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) sheet at the bottom and three sides of the beam and the effect of the additional layer of CFRP sheet in the section performance of the beam against progressive collapse. In this study, a 2-story frame is modeled using OpenSees software and retrofitted with the above techniques, and the effectiveness of each of these techniques is evaluated in the final performance. The results show that the best approach to reinforcing the beam is by rebar and CFRP, which has resulted in improved chain performance and the greatest reduction of vertical displacement in the beam.},

abstract = {Flat slabs with discontinuous bottom reinforcement are susceptible to progressive collapse if punching shear failure occurs at a slab-column connection. Many such failures have occurred in past earthquakes, resulting in significant loss of life. The evaluation of older flat-slab buildings must include a realistic prediction of the response of the slab-column connections. Considerable research has been performed on connections with continuous slab reinforcement; however, there is a lack of data on the performance of slab-column connections with discontinuous reinforcement. The research presented in this paper involved the cyclic lateral loading of six slab-column connections with discontinuous slab reinforcement typical of flat-slab buildings built prior to 1970. Punching shear failure does not appear to occur earlier than in equivalent specimens with continuous reinforcement; however, the consequences are significantly more severe. Based on this and prior research studies, a model is proposed for estimating the lateral drift at which punching failure may occur. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006, American Concrete Institute.

abstract = {RC flat slabs supported by an array of columns subjected to the action of impulsive pressure were investigated. The slabs were designed for static loads according to current standards. The dynamic responses of 4 × 4- and 8 × 8-column-supported slabs were similar, as were damage and failure. A simplified model consisting of a tributary area and a central column yielded similar results, demonstrating the accuracy of the simplified model and its reliability. These analyses exhibited modes of damage and failure characterized by large shear distortions in the slab–column connection zone. The rest of the span remained undamaged and in a horizontal position. In all analyses, the slab concrete around the column was fully damaged. The rebars failed within a limited zone at the slab–column connections. The early failure of integrity reinforcement indicated that it could not fulfill its duty; thus, a subsequent progressive collapse scenario was inevitable. All bent-up rebars failed, and their contribution to shear resistance was doubtful. The static analysis was entirely different from the dynamic failure mode. Impulsive loading damage and failure were similar to those in the case of slab-on-slab impact; in both cases, the slab underwent large displacement and severe damage in the narrow slab–column zone, whereas the rest of the slab remained almost completely flat and undamaged.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the effective length factor of frame–core wall structures with cross-layer columns, which are relevant for current high-rise building construction. Using the finite element method, improved inflection point method (D-value method), and GB50017-2017, the study investigated how the height and distribution of cross-layer columns affect the lateral stiffness ratio, natural vibration period, member internal force, maximum interlayer displacement angle, and effective length factor of the column in the frame–core wall structures. However, the force acting in the frame in the weak axis direction that is considered in GB50017-2017 does not reflect the actual mechanical behavior. Therefore, when determining the effective length factor of cross-layer columns, the interaction between the remaining frames' sub-structure and cross-layer columns is considered and the effective length factor is modified accordingly. A simplified model of a 140 m frame–core wall structure was established for analysis, and it was assumed that rigid links connect the frame and core wall hinged at both ends. The results show that increasing the height and number of cross-layer columns decreased the lateral stiffness ratio of the structure, and increased the maximum interlayer displacement angle and natural vibration period. Furthermore, the effective length factor of the structure decreased with an increase in height and the number of cross-layer columns. The modified effective length factor agrees well with the results obtained by the finite element method. These findings provide a useful reference for calculating the load-carrying capacity of cross-layer columns in engineering.},

abstract = {The inspection of sizeable plate-based metal structures such as storage tanks or marine vessel hulls is a significant stake in the industry, which necessitates reliable and time-efficient solutions. Although Lamb waves have been identified as a promising solution for long-range non-destructive testing, and despite the substantial progress made in autonomous navigation and environment sensing, a Lamb-wave-based robotic system for extensive structure monitoring is still lacking. Following previous work on ultrasonic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), we introduce a method to achieve plate geometry inference without prior knowledge of the material propagation properties, which may be lacking during a practical inspection task in challenging and outdoor environments. Our approach combines focalization to adjust the propagation model parameters and beamforming to infer the plate boundaries location by relying directly on acoustic measurements acquired along the mobile unit trajectory. For each candidate model, the focusing ability of the corresponding beamformer is assessed over high-pass filtered beamforming maps to further improve the robustness of the plate geometry estimates. We then recover the optimal space-domain beamformer through a simulated annealing optimization process. We evaluate our method on three sets of experimental data acquired in different conditions and show that accurate plate geometry inference can be achieved without any prior propagation model. Finally, the results show that the optimal beamformer outperforms the beamformer resulting from the predetermined propagation model in non-nominal acquisition conditions.},

In the present study, the concentrations of various criteria air pollutants (SPM, PM10, CO, SO2 and NOx) and organic pollutants such as benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were assessed before and after the implementation of CNG. A decreasing trend was found for PAHs, SO2 and CO concentrations, while the NOx level was increased in comparison to those before the implementation of CNG. Further, SPM, PM10, and BTX concentrations showed no significant change after the implementation of CNG. However, the BTX concentration demonstrated a clear relation with the benzene content of gasoline. In addition to the impact of the introduction of CNG the daily variation in PAHs levels was also studied and the PAHs concentrations were observed to be relatively high between 10 pm to 6 am, which gives a proof of a relation with the limited day entry and movement of heavy vehicles in Delhi. ?

In the proposed method, some portion of rotation induced in the torsional member is distributed to the flexibility of the equivalent columns, and the remaining portion is contributed to that of the equivalent slabs. In the consecutive companion paper, the proposed UEFM is verified by comparing with test results of multi-span flat plate structures.

The repair of deteriorated, damaged and substandard civil infrastructures has become one of the most important issues for the civil engineer worldwide. This important book discusses the use of externally-bonded fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites to strengthen, rehabilitate and retrofit civil engineering structures, covering such aspects as material behaviour, structural design and quality assurance. The first three chapters of the book review structurally-deficient civil engineering infrastructure, including concrete, metallic, masonry and timber structures. FRP composites used in rehabilitation and surface preparation of the component materials are also reviewed. The next four chapters deal with the design of FRP systems for the flexural and shear strengthening of reinforced concrete (RC) beams and the strengthening of RC columns. The following two chapters examine the strengthening of metallic and masonry structures with FRP composites. The last four chapters of the book are devoted to practical considerations in the flexural strengthening of beams with unstressed and prestressed FRP plates, durability of externally bonded FRP composite systems, quality assurance and control, maintenance, repair, and case studies. With its distinguished editors and international team of contributors, Strengthening and rehabilitation of civil infrastructures using fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites is a valuable reference guide for engineers, scientists and technical personnel in civil and structural engineering working on the rehabilitation and strengthening of the civil infrastructure.

abstract = {The progressive collapse of buildings may result in major financial losses and fatalities, so reducing the chances of such occurrences is of paramount importance. Due to the absence of beams for redistribution of gravity loads that were initially resisted by the missing column, flat slab buildings are more prone to progressive collapse than moment frame buildings. Thus, flat slab buildings should necessarily be assessed for progressive collapse and strengthened accordingly in order to avoid the likelihood of progressive collapse. This study evaluates the efficacy of three different strengthening methods for reducing the potential for progressive collapse of a validated 3-bay by 3-bay 4-storey flat slab building simulation model, subject to alternate, simultaneous and sequential removal of columns in the first storey. Corner, edge and interior columns of each building model are statically and instantaneously removed and the static and dynamic response of the building is compared for different removal sequences. The three strengthening strategies investigated are the addition of perimeter beams, the addition of shear walls and the addition of both perimeter beams and shear walls. The results are evaluated in terms of the vertical displacements at the top of the removed columns and the DCR of the sectional forces of critical adjacent columns, for which the acceptance criteria provided for DCR by the GSA is used to assess the vulnerability of the studied building to progressive collapse. The results show that perimeter beam, shear wall and combination of both perimeter beam and shear wall improve the progressive collapse resistance of the studied building by reducing DCR of critical columns by up to 67.0{\%} and reducing the vertical displacements at top of the removed column by up to 81.0{\%} depending on the different column removal cases.},

abstract = {Today, reinforced concrete (RC) structures are the most common structural system in Iran and in the world. Due to good performance in the construction of concrete walls, dual system of RC moment resisting frame with shear walls is one of the common structural systems in the structural engineering. Given the possibility of structural and environmental conditions, soil type, and owner needs, it should be mentioned that between dual systems the system such as intermediate RC moment resisting frame and intermediate RC shear walls have the most application in construction engineering. Determining the appropriate system including optimal span length and compressive strength of concrete for a specific number of floors is one of the important issues in designing in terms of economical design. In this paper, the effect of these parameters has been investigated in the structural construction cost by analysis and design of the many structural models. Generally, it can be concluded that in RC structures including intermediate RC moment resisting frame and intermediate concrete shear walls, increasing span length will lead to the rise in the structural construction cost, and increasing the strength of concrete will increase of structural construction cost despite decreasing the relative weight of structures.},

But, flat slab buildings are significantly more flexible than the conventional RC frame building, thus becoming more vulnerable to seismic loading. Therefore, in order to improve the performance, flat slab are usually provided with drop and column head or capital. In this paper, a (G+3) multi-storied building having flat slab with drop, flat slab with drop and column head and conventional slab systems with brick masonry infill wall has been analyzed separately for seismic zone V with soft soil by using SAP 2000 software and to improve the performance of building having flat slabs under seismic loading, provision of a portion of shear wall is also proposed in the present work. Linear dynamic response spectrum analysis is performed on the structures to get the seismic behavior and compare the parameters like storey displacement, storey drift, base shear and time period.},

abstract = {The flat slab system has been adopted in many buildings constructed recently due to the advantage of reduced floor heights to meet the economical and architectural demands. Structural engineers commonly use the "equivalent frame method" with equivalent beams proposed by Jacob S. Grossman in practical engineering for the analysis of flat slab structures. However, in many cases, when it is difficult to use the equivalent frame method, it is necessary to use a refined finite element model for an accurate analysis. However, this takes a significant amount of computational time and memory if the entire building structure were to be subdivided into a finer mesh. An efficient analytical method is proposed in this study to obtain accurate results in significantly reduced computational time. The proposed method employs super elements developed using the matrix condensation technique and fictitious beams are used in the development of super elements to enforce the compatibility at the interfaces of super elements. The stiffness degradation due to cracking in the flat slab system considered in the equivalent frame method was taken into account by reducing the modulus of elasticity of floor slabs based on linear elastic finite element analysis in this study. Static and dynamic analyses of example structures were performed and the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method were verified by comparing the results with those of the refined finite element model and the equivalent frame method. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The EFM was, however, originally developed for the flat plate structures subjected to gravity load, which is not suitable for lateral loading case. Therefore, this study, the first part of series research paper, proposed the structural analysis method for the flat plate slab structures under the combined gravity and lateral loads, which is named as the unified equivalent frame method (UEFM). In the proposed method, some portion of rotation induced in the torsional member is distributed to the flexibility of the equivalent columns, and the remaining portion is contributed to that of the equivalent slabs. In the consecutive companion paper, the proposed UEFM is verified by comparing with test results of multi-span flat plate structures. Also, a simplified nonlinear push-over analysis method is proposed, and verified by comparing to test results.},

abstract = {The problem of structural progressive collapse has been investigated using a real-scale reinforced concrete flat-slab frame building, which has survived collapse after two of its central columns had been physically destroyed. The numerical study undertaken considers three loading scenarios, in which alternately three different columns are being instantaneously removed, and in each case the structural response of the frame is calculated. A finite-element linear static analysis has first been conducted. To account for severe dynamic effects occurring during fast dynamic events, such as explosions or impacts, dynamic linear and nonlinear time history analyses have next been performed. For each scenario the results have been processed in terms of demand-resistance ratios at critical cross-sections, and thus it has been assessed whether the building would be susceptible to progressive collapse according to certain allowance criteria prescribed in technical guidelines. In this respect, three definitions of dynamic factors are introduced and their effective applicability is assessed in view of actually calculated and guidelines-suggested values. Results show overall that the approaches of linear static and dynamic analyses would have produced progressive collapse conditions. The nonlinear dynamic analysis predicts no mechanism which might lead to progressive collapse, even though several plastic hinges would be formed. Merits of using static or dynamic, linear or nonlinear analyses are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Steel-concrete composite structures are widely used in bridge and building construction. Flat slab system is commonly used in construction industry due to structural and architectural merits. Due to its easiness in construction and use, they are used in medium height residential buildings, offices, parking garages etc. Conventionally RC columns and RC slabs are used for construction practices. In this paper RC columns are replaced with steel tubular column. This owes to many advantages like faster construction, reduced size and superior structural performance. Punching shear failure at slab-column connection is a major cause of structural damage due to the smooth external finish of steel column. Punching shear resistance can be enhanced by providing shear connectors in the steel concrete interface. Shear connectors such as steel plates and steel sections are provided between steel column and flat slab, which is made of steel and is welded to the column and integrated into the flat slab. The work focuses on punching shear performance of column to slab connection using various shear connectors like steel plates, sections. This study presents comparison of different shear connectors that includes vertical plates, various cross-sections such as H, I, U, C, T in composite structures. Punching shear behaviour is studied by changing cross-section shapes. The composite structure is modelled and analysed using ANSYS software. The analytical results are investigated to study punching shear behaviour of the composite structure. The comparative study shows that the steel column-flat slab system using inverted C-shaped cross-section have higher punching shear capacity compared to various cross-sections.},

In order to determine the nonlinear behavior of buildings under lateral loads, base shear , displacement relationships, i.e. capacity curve are obtained by Pushover analysis. It is a type Non-linear Static Analysis, in which the strength of the structure is tested beyond the elastic limit of the structure. In present era, conventional RC Frame buildings are commonly used for the construction. The use of flat slab building provides many advantages over conventional RC Frame building in terms of architectural flexibility, use of space, easier formwork and shorter construction time. In the present work six numbers of conventional RC frame and Flat Slab with drop buildings of six, eight, and ten storey building models are considered. The performance of flat slab and conventional slab were studied and for the analysis, seismic zone III is considered. The analysis is done with using E-Tabs software. It is necessary to analyze seismic behavior of building for different heights to see what changes are going to occur if the height of conventional RC Frame building and flat slab building changes. Therefore, the characteristics of the seismic behavior of flat slab and conventional RC Frame buildings suggest that additional measures for guiding the conception and design of these structures in seismic regions are needed and to improve the performance of building having conventional RC building and flat slabs under seismic loading, The object of the present work is to compare the behavior of multi-storey building having flat slabs with drop and conventional RC frame and study the effect of height of the building on the performance of these two types of buildings under seismic forces. The obtained results are compared in terms of Time period, Base shear, Displacement, Storey drift. On comparison the base shear for flat slab is found to be greater than conventional slab structure, the variation is 67{\%}, 59{\%} and 49{\%} for six, eight and ten storey building. On comparison the displacement for flat slab is found to be less than conventional slab structure, the variation is 64 {\%}, 56{\%} and 41{\%} for six, eight and ten storey building.},

  abstract  = {This chapter covers various aspects of seismic design of reinforced concrete structures with an emphasis on design for regions of high seismicity. Because the requirement for greater ductility in earthquake-resistant buildings represents the principal departure from the conventional design for gravity and wind loading, the major part of the discussion in this chapter will be devoted to considerations associated with providing ductility in members and structures. The discussion in this chapter will be confined to monolithically cast reinforced-concrete buildings. The concepts of seismic demand and capacity are introduced and elaborated on. Specific provisions for design of seismic resistant reinforced concrete members and systems are presented in detail. Appropriate seismic detailing considerations are discussed. Finally, a numerical example is presented where these principles are applied. Provisions of ACI-318/95 and IBC-2000 codes are identified and commented on throughout the chapter.},

  abstract        = {A new shearhead system between a steel tubular column and a reinforced concrete flat slab has been developed. Compared with normal flat slab structure using reinforced concrete frames, this shearhead system allows thinner slab thickness, easier fabrication and shorter construction time. Two full-scale tests were conducted, one using a square steel tube and the other using a circular steel tube. The tests were simulated with the finite-element package Abaqus for validation of the numerical simulation model, which included load–displacement and load–strain curves, crack development and punching shear failure surfaces. A sensitivity study for the numerical model was carried out to examine the effects of different material properties and mesh sensitivity in order to select the most appropriate modelling parameters using Abaqus.},

The experimental findings enable the development of analytical models that depict the rotational response and flexural strength as a function of the shear-head embedment length, layout and section size. Additionally, the test results support the definition of a shear-head dependent control perimeter which is used in conjunction with the analytical slab models for full assessment of punching shear strength. The adequacy of strength predictions incorporated in current design methods for conventional reinforced concrete members are also examined in the paper. It is shown that existing design procedures either lack direct guidance for members provided with shear-heads, or lead to overly conservative strength predictions. Finally, in order to provide a reliable evaluation of the ultimate punching shear strength of hybrid elements, analytical design expressions which account for the characteristics of the shear-head system, are proposed. In comparison with conventional reinforced concrete design provisions, the suggested approach captures in a more realistic manner the influence of the embedded length of the shear-heads for such hybrid members with or without shear reinforcement.},

  abstract        = {Shear strength of reinforced concrete slab-column connections can be increased through the use of headed shear studs. To reduce interference with slab flexural reinforcement, stud rails are often placed in an orthogonal layout. In this layout, no stud rail is placed in regions extending from the corners of a column, as opposed to stud placement in a radial layout. Some experiments have found the absence of radial stud rails could lead to premature shear failure at slab-column connections. This problem may not have been noticeable in experiments that tested slabs with either short-spans or with a high flexural reinforcement ratio. This paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of these stud layouts in slab-column connections whose slabs have relatively low flexural reinforcement ratios. Three full-scale slab-column connections that represent a flat plate structure with 25 ft (7620 mm) spans were tested. All three specimens had an identical flexural design, in which the reinforcement ratio was 0.8{\%}. One specimen was built without shear reinforcement, and the remaining two specimens were reinforced with shear studs in either a radial or orthogonal layout. For the specimens with shear studs, calculated shear strengths were higher than their estimated flexural strengths.},

  abstract        = {There are a number of benefits associated with two-way concrete flat slab construction for office buildings, parking garages and apartments - for example, reduced formwork, prompt erection, flexibility of partitions, and minimal increase in story heights. However, concrete flat slabs could be quite vulnerable to punching shear failure in the event of a fire. The objective of the present article is to provide a state of the art review of the existing research and the issues associated with concrete flat slabs in fire and elevated temperature. There are a number of experimental and analytical studies on the punching shear behavior of concrete flat slabs in ambient conditions, available in the literature. Based on these studies, it is found that punching shear capacity in ambient condition is affected by many factors, which may not remain constant during a fire exposure. Only a limited number of studies on concrete flat slabs for punching shear failure in fire are available. This paper reviews the available experimental and analytical studies, standards and codes to address the research gap in estimating of punching shear strength of concrete flat slab-column connections without shear reinforcement.},

  abstract        = {This paper summarizes full-scale test results on CFT (concrete filled tube) column to RC (reinforced concrete) flat plate connections subjected to gravity loading. CFT construction is gaining wide acceptance due to its various structural and constructional advantages. However, efficient details for CFT column to RC flat plate connections have not been proposed yet. Based on the strategies that maximize economical field construction, several connecting schemes were proposed and tested in this study. Test results showed that the proposed connections can exhibit punching shear strength and connection stiffness exceeding those of RC flat plate counterparts. A semi-analytical procedure is presented to model the behavior of CFT column to RC flat plate connections. The parameters needed to model the behavior from elastic to post-punching range are calibrated based on the test data of this study. The application of the proposed model to progressive collapse analysis is also illustrated. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A novel detail is presented in which a gap is left around the column to enable the shearhead to yield in shear prior to the slab failing in punching shear. The proposed connection could serve as a primary lateral resisting system in low-rise buildings in regions of low to moderate seismicity or as a secondary system in areas of significant seismicity. Test results and numerical analyses are presented for a fully embedded ACI-type shearhead as well as the proposed partially embedded connection. The latter is shown to offer enhanced ductility compared with traditional forms. Experimental and numerical results are used to demonstrate the favourable inelastic performance of the proposed detail. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It was a five story reinforced concrete (RC) building with underground 4 floors and was built using a technique called " flat slab construction" The collapse is the largest peacetime disaster in South Korean history - 502 people died, 6 missing, and 937 sustained injuries. The Sampoong Department Store was completed in late 1989, and it opened to the public on July 7, 1990, attracting an estimated 40,000 people per day during the building's 5 years in service.After the collapse, intense investigation was conducted to find out the direct causes of the collapse through (1) survey on the present collapse situation and ground condition, (2) strength test of the concrete and steel collected at the site, (3) design documents and construction/management reports, and (4) structural analysis. The investigation revealed that the Sampoong Department Store collapsed because so many direct and indirect causes such as flaws in design phase and mistakes in construction and management process were overlapped. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

This paper investigates the dynamical characteristic in isolated neuron and chain neuronal networks with memristive autapse or synapses, respectively. Autapse plays important role in modulating the electrical activities, and thus the information encoding is enhanced. Within the improved neuron model, memristor is used to map the modulation of synapse current. Within an isolated new neuron model with memory, the modes in electrical activities can be controlled by the synapse current completely. Bifurcation analysis is carried out and mode transition is discussed. Furthermore, the modulation of synapse current on chain network is investigated, and the dependence of wave propagation on intensity of synapse is discussed. The diversity in synapse current can suppress the synchronization approach on the network.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents the results of a numerical and analytical investigation into the punching shear behaviour of an innovative simple and effective shear connection between steel tubular column and flat concrete slab using welded shear studs, steel plates and bent-up rebars. The finite element numerical simulation model was validated against two full-scale physical tests carried out by the authors. The validated numerical simulation model was used to perform extensive numerical parametric studies to investigate the effects of changing different design parameters including flat slab depth, concrete grade, bent-up rebar design, shear stud dimensions (length and diameter) and steel tube size, so as to develop thorough understanding of their punching shear behaviour and to provide comprehensive data for development of an analytical method for design. The developed analytical design method can be used to check capacities of shear studs, bent-up rebars and slab punching shear resistance. For this shear connection system, it is easy to prevent shear stud yield failure and bent-up rebar failure so that the system behaves as an enlarged column for calculating punching shear resistance of the slab. For the enlarged column, punching shear resistance calculation method in Eurocode 2 [2] can be used.},

  abstract        = {Reinforced concrete (RC) flat slab column structure is a typical vertical support system and is often used in regions of moderate seismicity. Additionally, a steel structure is easy to assemble and exhibits good mechanical property, ductility and energy dissipation performance. Thus, this study presents a new type of connection between a prefabricated RC flat slab and square steel tube column. The connection effectively improves seismic performance and stress mechanism and leads to plastic deformation in the cantilever beams that can be replaced after an earthquake. The connection consists of a column base with four cantilever beams, a channel steel connection, and an RC flat slab. A gap connected by four square crossing I-steel cantilever beams is left between the column and channel steel connection, and this forms an opening around the column. An experiment was performed to study the seismic behaviour of the prefabricated slab column connection. The effects of the key parameters including the I-steel web thickness of the cantilever beam and axial compression ratio were investigated. The failure modes, hysteretic curves, and stress–strain curves with respect to relevant components were presented. A numerical simulation verified by the tests was performed to analyse the section stress and bolt forces for making up the test deficiency. The results indicated that the prefabricated slab column connection exhibits a superior seismic performance, thereby leading to earthquake-resilience. Finally, design considerations were presented to guide engineering practice for the proposed prefabricated slab column connection.},

  abstract        = {Shear strength of reinforced concrete slab-column connections can be increased through the use of headed shear studs. To reduce interference with slab flexural reinforcement, stud rails are often placed in an orthogonal layout. In this layout, no stud rail is placed in regions extending from the corners of a column, as opposed to stud placement in a radial layout. Some experiments have found the absence of radial stud rails could lead to premature shear failure at slab-column connections. This problem may not have been noticeable in experiments that tested slabs with either short-spans or with a high flexural reinforcement ratio. This paper presents an experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of these stud layouts in slab-column connections whose slabs have relatively low flexural reinforcement ratios. Three full-scale slab-column connections that represent a flat plate structure with 25 ft (7620 mm) spans were tested. All three specimens had an identical flexural design, in which the reinforcement ratio was 0.8{\%}. One specimen was built without shear reinforcement, and the remaining two specimens were reinforced with shear studs in either a radial or orthogonal layout. For the specimens with shear studs, calculated shear strengths were higher than their estimated flexural strengths.},

  abstract = {For high-rise buildings, the storey height is an important factor influencing the economic efficiency of buildings. The structural system consisting of concrete filled tube columns and flat plate slabs is relatively new. However, the structural behavior of the connection between the concrete filled tube column and the flat plate slab has not yet been fully explored. The finite element analysis is therefore used to examine the stress concentration, load flow, and excessive deformation acting on the connection. Three types of connection details were compared. The analytical parameters are width, thickness of steel tube, length, thickness of wing plate, strength of steel, and eccentricity of rebar. 84 models were analyzed to find the appropriate design equation of the final connection detail. The corresponding proposed design equation showed a good agreement with the finite element analysis results.}

Eight specimens were strengthened with the introduction of prestressed vertical bolts, using different anchorage approaches: large anchorage on surface, small anchorage on surface and small embedded anchorage. A reference specimen, unstrengthened, was also tested. The experimental punching loads, failure modes and shear reinforcement contribution are compared with the provisions of EC2, ACI 318-11 and MC2010. The tests results show that using small embedded anchorage plates is viable and efficient method for punching capacity improvement. Additionally is a method also with advantages of better aesthetics for the final strengthened structure.}

  abstract = {One of the major problems of flat slab is the punching shear failure of slab-column connection. This form of failure must be avoided. Fourteen slab-column connections are tested to failure and categorized in two phases. The first “Phase I” consisted of testing ten interior square slabs axially loaded. The second “Phase II” consisted of testing four specimens under eccentric loading to study the influence of moment transfer at the slab-column connection on the punching shear failure of the slabs. The main parameters evaluated were, fiber volume ratio which was 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% and, punching area as dimensions of the square portion of the slab having steel fibers at the column vicinity of lengths d+200mm, 2d+200mm and 3d+200mm. All slabs have same dimensions of 1700mm×1700mm with thickness 150mm and reinforcement ratio of 1.2%. All tested specimens were loaded incrementally up to failure. However using steel fiber increased both the failure load and energy absorbing capacity. Summarily, it was found that slabs with a 1.5% steel fiber ratio led to high failure load capacity. Results showed that using steel fiber only in a portion of slab that is equal to slab thickness from column face was sufficient to give the optimum enhancement in both failure load and ductility behavior. Three-dimensional finite element model was created to using ANSYS R14.5 ANSYS (2012) program to simulate the behavior of the tested specimens. Crack pattern, mode of failure and energy absorption were analyzed here in this study.}

The experimental results were evaluated using a physical–mechanical model based on the critical shear crack theory (CSCT).

  abstract = {Flat-slab system is widely used nowadays. Major and critical problem of this system is its sudden brittle failure is called punching shear failure. To overcome the punching failure problem, there are many ways to increase the punching shear strength of concrete slabs, increasing slab thickness in the area adjacent to the column, increasing column thickness which is against the architectural desire, and finally providing slab with shear reinforcement. Shear reinforcement is more advanced from both the structural and economical point of view. An experimental program includes seven full scale square flat slab interior column specimens tested under gravity loads. All slabs have same dimensions of 1700 mm × 1700 mm with thickness 160 mm and reinforcement ratio of 1.2%. Column was square of 200 mm length and 250 mm height. Elongated steel strips of 25 mm width and 1.5 mm thickness undulated into the slab in different ways to investigate punching shear resistance. The program is divided into five groups. First group investigates the effect of installing the shear-band reinforcement (hanged up on top mesh, knit the top and bottom mesh together). The second group investigates the effect of inclination of shear reinforcement (shear band with vertical leg, with bended leg 45°). The third group investigates the effect of concentrating the shear reinforcement by increasing the quantity around the column. The fourth group investigates effect of radial distribution of shear-band system around the column. Finally, the fifth group investigates the effect of box distribution of shear-band system around the column.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to evaluate hysteretic behavior of exterior post-tensioned flat plate slab–column connections (PT connections) designed to resist only gravity loads. For this purpose, experimental studies were conducted using three approximately two-thirds-scale test specimens; two exterior PT connection specimens having different tendon layouts and one exterior reinforced concrete flat plate slab–column connection (RC connection) specimen. Quasi-static cyclic loading was applied to the specimen with a constant gravity load. All specimens had bottom bonded reinforcement around the column as required by ACI 352.1R-89. This study collects previous test results to draw a general conclusion for the hysteretic behavior of the PT exterior connections. This study observed that the tendon layout influenced the hysteretic behavior of PT exterior connections, which means that lateral drift capacity, dissipated energy, failure mechanism, and ductility vary with respect to tendon layouts. Moreover, this study shows that the amount of bottom reinforcement specified by the ACI 352.1R-89 is sufficient for resisting positive moments resulting from moment reversal under the cyclic loading. Shear strength of the test specimens is more accurately predicted by the shear strength equation considering average compressive strength (fpc) due to post-tensioning tendons than that without considering fpc.}

  abstract = { In high seismic regions, post-tensioned (PT) slab–column frames are commonly used to support gravity loads in conjunction with a lateral-force resisting system (LFRS) such as a core wall. The LFRS is designed to resist 100\% of the design lateral forces as well as to limit lateral displacements to an acceptable level, whereas the slab–column frame must sustain the gravity loads under the expected (design) displacements. Given the relatively sparse data on the seismic performance of PT flat plate slab–column frames, cyclic tests of four interior PT slab–column connections were conducted. Primary test variables were the level of gravity shear at the slab–column connection and the slab tendon arrangement. Test results indicate that both the test variables strongly influence the cyclic behaviour of the PT connections, and that the use of slab bottom reinforcement at the slab–column connection was effective in resisting positive moment developed under lateral loading as well as improving the hysteretic energy dissipation capacity. }
